    "Scientific programming is a subset of generic programming with specific goals: it needs to be simple to code, understandable to read, and performant. The last requirement is particularly important as data becomes larger and more accessible and models more complex. The unfortunate reality is that typically a programming language is very readable and easy to program in (think: R and Python) or unwiedly but fast (think: C++). Julia claims to do both.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to interact with the REPL, just as we would an interpreted language, with familiar function names and a mathematical like syntax. It is also designed from the ground up to support parallel computing paradigms making it ideal for the world of high performance computing (HPC). Finally, it's compiler is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler reliant on the low level virtual machine (LLVM) and is very well optimised making it very fast - orders of magnitude faster than R or Python. In fact, most of Julia code is written in Julia itself whereas most performant Python code is written in C (this is the two-language problem). This means Julia can be used as scripting language and then quickly turned into optimised code which saves on development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a rosy picture - what are the drawbacks? It's quite memory hungry compared to modern alternatives such as Rust, and uses a garbage collector (this is usually not a problem for scientific programming). It's JIT compiler means that the first time to run any code is *slow* and requires us to adopt a different workflow. Its a new language: long term support (LTS) and version 1.0 came out just a few years ago. Therefore, the package ecosystem, particularly in the life sciences, is not as extensive as R's Bioconductor, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "These drawbacks, with the exception of packaging, are very minor. Package support is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem but the advantages of the language make Julia very worthwhile to learn."

    "It would be quite tedious to type out large amount of numbers and it becomes difficult to keep track of various commas, semi-colons, and spaces. It is often easier to construct arrays with some predefined functions. The most general constructor form is is ``Array{::Type, rank}(intialiser, dims...)``. Here the rank is the order of the tensor (1: vector, 2: matrix, etc...) while dims indicates the length of each dimension. The initialiser is usually left as ``undef`` which means undefined. Let's create a rank 3 tensor with dimensions (4,2,10):"

An essential feature of control flow is the notion of Booleans and truth statements. A boolean is a type which indicates a logical value: ``true`` or ``false``. These are usually the outputs of logical queries which are most commonly constructed with the binary operators. Some common and useful ones are: and (&&), or (||), less than (<), greater than (>), equal to (==), and greaterequal/lessequal (>=, <=). These are not exhaustive, Julia has many others such as those from [set logic](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/) or the xor operator and we can consult the documentation for further details.

    "There are two forms of syntatic sugar that many people like to employ in Julia. The first is the ternary operator which lets us write ``if`` statements in a single line, and the other is loop comprehension which lets us write ``for`` statements in a single line. In general, these decrease the readability of our code so they can be avoided. They can be very helpful in anonymous functions calls. Also, other people very much like using them, so watch out!\n",

    "The list comperhension takes the form: ``[f(i) for i in iter]`` where i is the loop variable, iter is the collection being iterated over, and f(i) is the loop execution block. The result is a vector containing the sequential applications of ``f`` to the loop variable.\n",

    "### 3.2 Multiple Dispatch (Advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to one of the key selling features of Julia: multiple dispatch. Multiple dispatch essentially allows us to overload a function definition so that it can apply (dispatch) different methods based on the data type it receives. This is incredibly important: many functions we think of as quite intuitive have many different specific meanings and implementations based on a host of factors. Think about squaring a number and squaring a matrix; they both \"make sense\" and the operator should remain the same, but the computational procedures are very different. Multiple dispatch allows us to keep conventions that make sense, decide on faster routines if the high precision is not required, or different more precise methods if it is. Many of Julia's base operators are already overloaded.\n",

The best practice here is to start with AbstractAny types and let the compiler do its own type inference and once the code is working to progressively make the functions more restrictive. The second is performance. As we have seen the compiler is very flexible and can mutate types and perform type conversions to make certain operations make sense: these come at a cost. By specifiying all of our types at runtime we let the compiler know what to expect and by making our code type-stable we can get substantial performance gains. Type mutations add a lot of bloat."

    "In other scientific languages such as Python, R, and Matlab vectorisation is taught as best practice. We often find ourselves writing a lot of pencil-on-paper linear algebra to find a way to express our code in a vectorised format. We are also taught to avoid loops like the plague. This is because the vectorised functions have been compiled in a special way to use tricks to get a speed up. Loop unrolling is often slow and comes with a performance penalty. We will make use of the ``@btime`` macro from the ``BenchmarkTools`` package to show that there is very little difference between the two in Julia:"

    "The slight edge goes to the vectorised multiplication *but* this was just rough-and-ready code with no performance enhancements. In the next notebook we will go through how to improve this code with some optimisations and we will find it actually *outperforms* the vectorised code. This is, in some sense, remarkable: it allows us to change our workflow and expand our horizons to generically complicated functions *without* the performance hit. As an example think about indexing on every even element on the vector and every odd row on the matrix and performing the same calculation: a pseudo matrix multiply. This would be difficult to vectorise and would require many more memory allocations. It's trivial in the loop format."

    "## 4 Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is a computational paradigm whereby functions are given first-class status and they are used to operate on data. This is different from the traditional object oriented paradigm whereby objects are created and are given methods (functions) and attributes (data) in their fields. Both of these paradigms are useful and very few languages (or programmers) operate in strictly one or the other; projects exist conceptually and literally as a combination of both. Scientific programming lends itself well to thinking it terms of functional programming and Julia (while it can do both) is well suited to accomodate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through some functions that are commonly asscociated with functional programming (but really are just very useful functions so use them how you please). They are included here because they encourage us to think about functional patterns and can improve code readability, stability, and portability! They can also make you write readable code in one line!\n",

    "## 5.0 Basic Worflow: Notebooks, REPL, Scripting,  Some Useful Funcitons\n",
    "Julia has a number of different ways that we can interact with it. We have been using a notebook and should be fairly familiar with by now. The most common method is by using the REPL which is a shell like environment which can be accessed by entering ``julia`` into the terminal. In the REPL we can enter commands and get results. Try it out now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to repeatedly rerun a series of commands. For this we type them into a script with file extension .jl. We can include the script with the ``include(\"path/to/script.jl\")`` command which is similiar to R's ``source`` command. We can also execute them directly from the terminal with ``julia path/to/script.jl``. In general, it is not advisable to use the latter method because it starts up a new process every time and all functions need to be precompiled again. This makes it very slow for scripting work. The common practice is to open a single Julia session and run all scripts from inside the REPL. We will cover a slightly more advanced workflow in the next notebook."
