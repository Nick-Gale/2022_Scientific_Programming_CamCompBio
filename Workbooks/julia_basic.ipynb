    "Scientific programming is a subset of generic programming with specific goals: it needs to be simple to code, understandable to read, and performant. The last requirement is particularly important as data becomes larger and more accessible and models more complex. The unfortunate reality is that typically a programming language is very readable and easy to program in (think: R and Python) or unwiedly but fast (think: C++). Julia claims to do both.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to interact with the REPL, just as we would an interpreted language, with familiar function names and a mathematical like syntax. It is also designed from the ground up to support parallel computing paradigms making it ideal for the world of high performance computing (HPC). Finally, it's compiler is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler reliant on the low level virtual machine (LLVM) and is very well optimised making it very fast - orders of magnitude faster than R or Python. In fact, most of Julia code is written in Julia itself whereas most performant Python code is written in C (this is the two-language problem). This means Julia can be used as scripting language and then quickly turned into optimised code which saves on development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a rosy picture - what are the drawbacks? It's quite memory hungry compared to modern alternatives such as Rust, and uses a garbage collector (this is usually not a problem for scientific programming). It's JIT compiler means that the first time to run any code is *slow* and requires us to adopt a different workflow. Its a new language: long term support (LTS) and version 1.0 came out just a few years ago. Therefore, the package ecosystem, particularly in the life sciences, is not as extensive as R's Bioconductor, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "These drawbacks, with the exception of packaging, are very minor. Package support is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem but the advantages of the language make Julia very worthwhile to learn."

These are not exhaustive, Julia has many others such as those from [set logic](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/) or the xor operator and we can consult the documentation for further details.

    "### 3.2 Multiple Dispatch (Advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to one of the key selling features of Julia: multiple dispatch. Multiple dispatch essentially allows us to overload a function definition so that it can apply (dispatch) different methods based on the data type it receives. This is incredibly important: many functions we think of as quite intuitive have many different specific meanings and implementations based on a host of factors. Think about squaring a number and squaring a matrix; they both \"make sense\" and the operator should remain the same, but the computational procedures are very different. Multiple dispatch allows us to keep conventions that make sense, decide on faster routines if the high precision is not required, or different more precise methods if it is. Many of Julia's base operators are already overloaded.\n",

The best practice here is to start with AbstractAny types and let the compiler do its own type inference and once the code is working to progressively make the functions more restrictive. The second is performance. As we have seen the compiler is very flexible and can mutate types and perform type conversions to make certain operations make sense: these come at a cost. By specifiying all of our types at runtime we let the compiler know what to expect and by making our code type-stable we can get substantial performance gains. Type mutations add a lot of bloat."
