# Workbooks

The workbooks are provided in .ipynb (notebook) format.  You are
encouraged to work through these yourself.  To do this, you will need
to install several packages.  See [install_julia.md](install_julia.md) notes,
which should get you started on your laptop or on
subliminal.maths.cam.ac.uk.
