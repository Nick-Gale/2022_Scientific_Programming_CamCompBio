# Converting to PDF

I hit one problem using Beamer to convert the qmd to pdf:

<https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3076>

Will need to document this better for 'future self'.

This was solved by installing JuliaMono font.



## Installing JuliaMono font

To install the font, first download it from:

<https://juliamono.netlify.app/download/>

and then follow the clear instructions on that page for your operating system.
