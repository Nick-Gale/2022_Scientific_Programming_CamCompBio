## Course Objectives

In this course we will cover:

* Why we want to learn Julia.

* How to interact with Julia and the basics.

* The key differences between Julia and R.

* Several advanced concepts: types and structures, optimisation, high performance computing.

* Some essential packages: Plotting, Statistics, Distributed, CUDA.

## A new language?

* A new language needs to offer benefits over the existing language.
* Current paradigm is a two language development cycle - the *two-language problem*. 
* This is not elegant and lots of code is rewritten. 

::: {.notes}
* By now you should be quite familiar with R (and likely some others: Python, MatLab, Mathematica etc.) Why should we bother to learn another language?
* Things are developed in an "easy" (to use) interpreted language like R, and when they need to be optimised they are rewritten in C with an interface (Numpy, Cython, rcpp).
:::

## Why Julia? 
* Julia offers a solution to the two language problem: it is fast *and* flexible.

* It uses a method called just-in-time (JIT) compiliation to generate compiled code just before it is needed.

* Easy to develop in.

::: {.notes}
* There is a penalty to compile the first time you run code

* This means it can be used like an interpreted language such as Python/R while having many of the performance aspects of C

* It is extremely well optimised for scientific computing and is a joy to develop in: performant, syntactic sugar tastes like maths, and easily scalable to correct level of abstraction.

* In addition to this, several other considered design choices have led to very elegant code.
:::

## Interacting with Julia

* Three primary ways to interact with Julia: Notebooks, terminal, and REPL.

* The notebook format is through the "IJulia" package and Jupyter notebook software. This is exactly like Python and R notebooks but with Julia code.

* The terminal can be used to execute scripts with the bash command `julia path/to/script`. 

* REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop and is an interactive Julia session initiated by running `julia` in terminal.

::: {.notes}
* Terminal scripting can be useful for large scale server jobs but is in general *not recommended*.
:::

## REPL
* The REPL can execute basic commands or run scripts with the include function:

::: fragment
```{julia} 
include("my_first_script.jl")
```
:::

* Scripting in the REPL is costly *once*. Scripting from terminal is costly *everytime*.

* `println(arg)` is the method for printing (print works, but doesn't generate a new line).

* `display(arg)` creates a user-friendly readout in the ```
<!-- SJE: is something missing here? -->
<!-- :::L. -->

::: {.notes}
* The REPL  also lets you run quick commands between script being called.
* This is the recommended scripting workflow because for every new Julia session each package needs to be pre-compiled
* Some packages such as `Plots.jl` incur a large cost for this precompiliation
:::

---

* Working in the REPL is very intuitive: functions generally have very mathematical names.

* Variable assignment is done through the `=` operator, equality is tested through the `==` operator, and indistinguishability through the `===` operator. This is different to R which uses the `<-` assignment operator and the ``identical(a,b)`` function for indistinguishability.


::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = 1.0
b = 1
println(a == b)
println(a === b)
```
:::


::: {.notes}
* Types are inferred automatically unless specified: `a` was inferred as a float and `b` as an integer. They are numerically equal, but not indistinguishable.
:::

## Operators

* Operators are the same as in R (+, -, \*, ^, etc).

* Mod is given by `mod(a,b)` not `%%` but remainder is still `%`.

* Unlike R, Julia supports infix operators: +=, -=, \*=, /=.

* Infix operators modifiy a variable in-place and can be very useful e.g. loops:

::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = 0
a += 1
println(a)
```
:::

## Vectors

* A vector is created with square brackets and is column delimited as opposed to R's `c(tuple...)`:

::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = [1, 2, 4.0, 1]
```
:::

---

* A vector can be indexed through integer, logical, and cartesian indexes using square brackets `[]`. Ranges are covered by the ``:`` operator

* Logical indexes must be the same size as the array, unlike in R.

::: fragment
```{julia} 
println(a[2])
println(a[[true, false, true, false]])
println(a[CartesianIndex(1)])
println(a[2:4])
```
:::

---

* Julia doesn't support negative indexing like in R

* It does have a keyword `end` which references the end of a vector and can be combined with arithmetics to create consistent negative indexing

::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
println(a[2:2:(end-1)])
```
:::

## Matrices

* A matrix is created with semi-colons to delimit rows and spaces (or ``;;``) to delimit columns.

::: fragment
```{julia} 
a =	 [1 2 3;
	8 9 10;
	4 -30 0]
```
:::
---

* Matrices are column ordered so a linear index will access elements in the column first.

::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = [1 2 3; 8 9 10; 4 -30 0];
println(a)
println(a[4])
println(a[CartesianIndex(2,1)])
println(a[2, 3])
println(a[1:2, 2:3])
```
:::
 

## Multi Dimensional Arrays

* Generally, `;` concatenates in the first dimension `;;` in the second and so on...

* Higher order arrays can be constructed like this, but it is generally cumbersome.

* Multidimensional indexes extend the rules for vectors and matrices:
  `[dim1, dim2, dim3...]`
  
::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = [1; 2;; 3; 4;; 5; 6;;;
        7; 8;; 9; 10;; 11; 12]

println(a[10])
println(a[CartesianIndex(2, 3, 2)])
```
:::

## General Arrays and Construction

* In Julia ranges can be created with steps like in R and are
  iterables but they are non-allocating (in R they create a vector). 
  
::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = 2:50:300
println(a[4])
println(a)
println(typeof(a))
```
:::

## Collect

* Vectors can be created with the `collect` function which works on
  any iterable collection.
  
::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = collect(2:50:300)
println(a)
println(typeof(a))
```
:::

## Preallocation

* Preallocation can be done with `ones(dims...)` and `zeros(dims..)`

::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = ones(2,3,5)
b = zeros(4,4)
display(a)
display(b)
```
:::
## Concatenation

* Arrays can be abstractally contactentated using space, and semilcolons `;`, `;;`, `;;;`.

* Horizontal concatentation is through `hcat(array1, array2, ...)` 

* Vertical concatentation is through using `vcat(arrays...)`. 

::: fragment
```{julia}
a = ones(3,3);
b = zeros(3,3);
display(hcat(a,b))
display(vcat(a,b))
```
::: 

## Strings

* A character is indicated by apostrophes `'a'`.

* A string is a partial function from indexes to character literals. Unlike R apostrophes will not work, use double quotes ``"a"`` or triple double quotes `""" a """`.

* Triple double quotes allow some flexibility which can be useful in writing internal scripts:

::: fragment
```{julia} 
"""The triple quotes allow for "quotes" to be embedded into a string."""
```
:::

## String Indexing

* Strings can be indexed in Julia like in R and unlike R are not decoded into a character vector

::: fragment
```{julia} 
a = "A very long string"
println(a[2:2:10])
```
:::

## Control Flow

* True and False are given by the `true` and `false` keywords. 

* Logical true and false are: 0 and 1.

* Control flow blocks always have an `end` to terminate them. They are initiated with a special keyword. They don't usually have curly braces like in R.

::: fragment
```{julia}
println(true == false)
println(true == 1)
println(false == 0)
```
:::

## If, else, and elseif

* If blocks can have optional `elseif` and `else` keywords inside the
  block:
  
::: fragment
```{julia} 
cond = true
if cond
	println("If this wasn't true, nothing would happen")
end
```
:::

---


::: fragment
```{julia} 
condelse = 1
if condelse==2
	println("It's an even prime!")
else
	println("It wasn't true. The else block executed")
end
```
:::

---

::: fragment
```{julia} 
condif = false	
condelse = "three"
if condif == 1
	println("We miss this one")
elseif condelse == "three"
	println("The elseif block executes")
else
	println("The else block doesn't")
end
```
:::
## Ternary Operator

* The ternary operator can execute if one-liners: `` conditional_expression ? iftrue_code_execute : else_code_execute ``.

::: fragment
```{julia}
res = (8 < 4) ? "Maths broke." : "Situation Normal"
println(res)
```
:::

## While

* While statements are also executed when a conditional expression
  evaluates as true. They can be useful in loops:
  
::: fragment
```{julia} 
i = 0
while i < 10
	i+=1
	println("Not done yet..")
end
println("Done")
```
:::

## For Loops
* For loops operate in the same way as R with the `for var in collection` structure.

* They can operate over any abstract collection or vector.

* The `in` operator can be replaced with `=`.

::: fragment
```{julia} 
for i = 1:2
	println(i)
end
println()
for i in 20:22
	println(i)
end
```
:::

## List Comprehension

* Julia supports list comprehension: `[ expression(i) for i in collection]` generates a vector with objects specified by expression i.

::: fragment
```{julia} 
vec = [i^2 for i in 1:4:33]
```
:::

## Functions

* Functions are similarly defined as in R, but instead of setting the function name as an object of the function method we use a function block.

* Functions are defined with the keyword `function` followed by the specification of the function name and arguments.

* Functions have a return keyword which will return the moment the keyword is reached.

---

::: fragment
```{julia} 
function complex_modulus1(x, iy)
	tmp = x^2 + iy^2
	return sqrt(tmp)
end
```
:::

* If there is no return keyword the function will return the last line.

---

* Functions can be written in one line in a mathematical format.

::: fragment
```{julia} 
complex_modulus(x, iy) = sqrt(x^2 + iy^2)
```
:::

* The recommended structure is to use a function block with a return keyword.

## Splatting

* Variable arguments are given by the splat `...` operator.

* Can be used in function definition. 

::: fragment
```{julia} 
function g(x...)
	return x
end
gvec = [1, 2, 3, "EOL"]
println(g(gvec))
```
:::

---

* Splatting can also be used in calls to functions with multiple arguments.

::: fragment
```{julia}
function f(x1, x2, x3)
	return [x1, x2, x3]
end
fvec = [5,"a",1.0]
println(f(fvec...))
```
:::

* Unlike R `...` must be attached to a variable name

## Anonymous Functions
* Anonymous functions in Julia are given using the `->` operator. This is *assignment* in R as opposed to the `function(x) exp_x` syntax in R.
* Functions are first class objects in Julia so these may be assigned
  variable names or exist as standalones
  
::: fragment
```{julia}
F = x -> x^2
println(F(2))
```
